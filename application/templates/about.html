    <p>Hello!</p>

    <p>This post was created to help new developers learn more about key concepts of programming.</p>
    <p>I mainly post articles about things that I found important when I first started my journey into programming or things that I want to learn/improve upon.</p>
    <p>Cheers,</p>
